Use DFS to implement topological sort. The input is not a DAG --
but the example is -- so we can't do a complete ordering over all
the input. However, the fine print says we can ignore pages that
aren't part of the order, so we *can* sort the pages we need.

By the time all that is sorted out, part 2 reduces to a sorting
problem, because we already know the relative placement of pages.
