Part 1: reuse AOC::Grid from library. Consider crossing paths already
seen, including the '^' at the start.

Part 2: To create a block, the obstacle must be placed on the path.
Make one pass to determine every cell that is visited. Then, for
each cell, clone the map, set a block, and run the patrol until we
hit a loop or exit.

Thing that didn't work 1: walk the path but at each cell, check if
a right turn would put us on a cell we've already seen, traveling
in the correct direction. Flaw: a block could move us way off the
original path, and have a loop there. Undercounts by a lot.

Thing that didn't work 2: when we move a cell, fill the entire row
or column (between blocks) and if we ever re-enter any cell in the
same direction, detect a loop. Flaw: same as 1, but faster.

Loop detection: record all the turns, position and turn. For example,
([7,6], ">v"). It's a loop if we find ourselves turning the same
way at the same cell.

Loop detection. Failed attempt: for every cell, record the direction
that we entered, and see if we are moving the same direction again.
Not sure why it didn't work, lots of fiddly bookkeeping.
