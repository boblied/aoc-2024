First guess is to use depth first search to explore possible results.

Better thought is to work backwards.

If the result is a multiple of the last number, then the last op
must have been multiplication. Otherwise, it must have been addition.
Undo that op (divide by last, or subtract last), and recurse with
the next-to-last term.  If we get down to one term left, it has to
be equal to the remaining goal number.

Part 2: using the same backwards strategy, add the third possibility:
remove the last term if it's a suffix of the goal.

Bad moves: 1) DFS is over-complicated, never got it to work right.
2) There are duplicate goal numbers in the input. Don't store them
in a hash because that will cause them to be evaluated only once,
and if two duplicates are valid, the sum will come up short.
