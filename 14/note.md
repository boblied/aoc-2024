# Adevent of Code 2024 Day 14

## Part 1

Move the robots at every clock tick. Count the quadrants at the end.
Straight-forward. Minor hassle with modulo arithmetic at wrapping.

## Part 2

What does a tree look like? Is it outlined or filled?
Does it use all the robots? Do they overlap?
Is it just a triangle, or does it have branches? Does it have a trunk?

How do we detect a tree pattern? Assume it's symmetrical. Is it centered
in the room?

Started out assuming it would be centered in the room, and using all 500 robots.
Then, minimal test is that left and right quadrants would have the same number
of robots (was that a hint from part 1?). And then, all rows must be symmetric.

Turns out not to work for at least 100,000 iterations.

Clue from Reddit was to look for a horizontal line. Run until a horizontal
segment appears. That got the answer, by printing the grid and looking at it.

Turns out the tree is not centered in the room, in a small rectangle, and
only using a few of the robots.

Still not sure how I would program the image recognition, not knowing what
size or shape to expect.
